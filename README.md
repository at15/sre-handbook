# sre-handbook

This handbook is a combination of introduction to operating system and computer network,
which is useful for not only site reliability engineers, but also most programmers.
I use it as a memo, and it can be used as a quick recap for preparing interview.

## Usage

- [Read it online](https://at15.gitbooks.io/sre-handbook)
- [Install GitBook](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook/blob/master/docs/setup.md),
clone the repository, read it locally. (I prefer this one)
